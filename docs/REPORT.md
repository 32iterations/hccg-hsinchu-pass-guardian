## Implementation Details

### TDD Methodology

All implementations followed strict TDD cycles:

1. **RED Phase**: Tests written first to define behavior
2. **GREEN Phase**: Minimal implementation to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Code optimization while maintaining test pass

## Critical Implementation Features

### Security & Privacy

1. **Data Anonymization**
   - SHA-256 hashing with salts for device addresses
   - K-anonymity (k=5) for volunteer hits
   - Grid square fuzzing (100m precision)
   - 5-minute timestamp rounding

2. **Access Control**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - RBAC with granular permissions
   - Resource-level access control
   - Audit logging for all sensitive operations

3. **Data Protection**
   - TTL-based data retention
   - Immediate anonymization on revocation
   - Encrypted storage for sensitive data
   - GDPR-compliant data handling

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching Strategy**
   - In-memory cache for frequent queries
   - Redis-based session management
   - Optimistic locking for concurrent updates

2. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling support
   - Database connection pooling
   - Asynchronous processing queues
   - Event-driven architecture
