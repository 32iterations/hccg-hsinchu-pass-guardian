1. ✅ **Functional Completeness**: All priority features implemented
2. ✅ **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, well-structured
3. ✅ **Security**: Privacy protection and access controls
4. ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive and up-to-date
5. ✅ **CI/CD**: Production-ready pipeline

### Acceptance Conditions Pending:
1. ⏸️ **Test Coverage**: Must reach >80% (currently 22.47%)
2. ⏸️ **Test Stability**: All tests must pass (8 failing)
3. ⏸️ **Mobile Validation**: React Native components need testing
