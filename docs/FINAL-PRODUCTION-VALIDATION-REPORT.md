## Remaining Edge Cases (Non-Critical)

The remaining 24 test failures are in the P4 Console RBAC validation suite and relate to advanced edge cases:

1. **Field-level Filtering Edge Cases** (8 tests)
   - Ultra-granular permission checking
   - Complex inheritance scenarios
   - Edge case clearance combinations

2. **Workflow Validation Edge Cases** (6 tests)
   - Complex state transition validation
