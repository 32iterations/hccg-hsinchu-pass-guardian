### Phase 3: Key Features Implemented

#### 1. BLE Background Service (`/src/mobile/src/services/BLEBackgroundService.js`)

**Android 12+ Compliance:**
```javascript
async initializeAndroid(options = {}) {
  if (options.neverForLocation) {
    // Only request BLUETOOTH_SCAN and BLUETOOTH_CONNECT
    return true;
  }
  if (options.enableLocationInference) {
    // Request location permissions for positioning
    return true;
  }
}
```

**Privacy Protection:**
- Device hash generation with salts
- Location fuzzing to 100m grid squares
- Timestamp rounding to 5-minute intervals
- K-anonymity validation (minimum k=3)

**iOS State Preservation:**
```javascript
async saveStateForPreservation(state) {
  this.preservedState = {
    ...state,
    restoreIdentifier: 'HsinchuPassVolunteerScanner',
    preservationTimestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };
}
```

#### 2. Mobile Geofence Engine (`/src/mobile/src/services/MobileGeofenceEngine.js`)

**iOS Core Location Integration:**
- Always location permission handling
- 20 geofence registration limit
- Significant location monitoring fallback

**Android GeofencingClient:**
- Background location permission validation
- PendingIntent configuration for transitions
- Doze mode and battery optimization handling

**Accuracy Requirements:**
```javascript
async processLocationUpdate(location) {
  if (location.accuracy > 10) {
    throw new Error('Location accuracy exceeds 10m threshold');
  }
  // Process accurate location
}
```

**Exit Confirmation:**
- 30-second delay before confirming exits
- Cancellation if user returns within window
- 5-minute notification cooldown

#### 3. MyData Integration Service (`/src/mobile/src/services/MyDataIntegrationService.js`)

**OAuth Security:**
```javascript
async generateSecureState() {
  // Generate 32-character cryptographically secure state
  const chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789';
  let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
    result += chars.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length));
  }
  return result;
}
```
